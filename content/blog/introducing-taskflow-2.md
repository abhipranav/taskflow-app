# Introducing TaskFlow 2.0: Focus Mode & Time Tracking

We've been listening to your feedback, and today we're thrilled to announce **TaskFlow 2.0** — our most significant update since launch. This release brings three game-changing features designed to help you stay focused, track your time, and communicate better with your team.

## What's New

### 🎯 Focus Mode (Today View)

Ever open your task manager and feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of items? Focus Mode solves this by showing you only what matters *right now*.

**How it works:**
- See overdue tasks that need immediate attention
- View today's tasks in a clean, distraction-free list
- Quick-complete tasks with a single click
- High-priority items are highlighted automatically

Access Focus Mode anytime by clicking "Today" in the sidebar or pressing `T` anywhere in the app.

### ⏱️ Built-in Time Tracking

No more switching between your task manager and a separate time tracking app. TaskFlow now includes native time tracking that integrates seamlessly with your workflow.

**Features:**
- One-click timer start/stop on any task
- Manual time entry for past work
- Progress bar showing time spent vs. estimated
- Weekly time reports in the Analytics dashboard

### 🤖 AI-Powered Standup Reports

Writing daily standups is tedious. Let AI do it for you.

TaskFlow analyzes your completed tasks, current progress, and upcoming work to generate professional standup reports in seconds. Simply:

1. Go to the Standup page
2. Click "Generate Report"
3. Copy and paste into Slack, email, or your team's communication tool

## Quick Capture Widget

We've also added a **Quick Capture** feature. Press `Q` anywhere to instantly capture a task without losing context. The widget includes:

- Voice-to-task input (speak your task)
- Smart board/column selection
- AI-suggested priority levels

## What's Next

We're already working on the next wave of features:

- **Recurring Tasks**: Set tasks to repeat daily, weekly, or monthly
- **Task Dependencies**: Define blocked-by relationships
- **Calendar Sync**: Two-way sync with Google Calendar

## Try It Now

All these features are available today for all TaskFlow users. No upgrade required — just refresh your app and explore!
